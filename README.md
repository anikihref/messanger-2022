# Motives

The main motive of creative this project is self teaching. Especially learn or remind more different technologies: 
    - React
    - WebSockets
    - HTTP
    - Tailwindcss
    - Typescript

I am seriosly motivated while I'm creating this project and try to spend at least 2 hours to make it better. 
My messenger is far from best messengers but i still believe that I won't lost my interest and continue develop it. Currently I am interested at becoming middle fullstack web developer and sure that this project will move me few steps closer to middle fullstack web dev.

This project is special because: 
    - It made by me
    - Made by using newest technologies
    - Easy for understading and using
